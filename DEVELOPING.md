# Developing

## Running the dev server
The videojs-ima plugin includes a continuous build dev server you can use to
manually test changes as you make them. To start developing, run the following:

```
npm install
npm run devServer
```

and open http://localhost:8080 in your browser. This will take you to our list
of samples. When you save source files, the development server will re-compile
the JavaScript and you can refresh the page to see your changes.
